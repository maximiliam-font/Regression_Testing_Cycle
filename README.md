## Regression Testing of Urban Routes Application
>"If you ignore the past, you jeopardize the future."
<br/>
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive regression testing process on the Urban Routes transportation application, validating key system functionalities and ensuring that recent changes did not affect user experience or existing business logic.
The main objective was to guarantee that the application remained consistent, accurate, and stable in critical flows, applying QA techniques, testing methodologies, and quality criteria typical of a QA Engineer.

## 🎯 Project Objective
Ensure that all functionalities of Urban Routes execute correctly after updates or changes to the application, identifying defects, validating expected versus actual results, and documenting findings in a structured and traceable manner.

## Key Areas Validated
- 🚖 Full execution of regression test cases.
- 🔍 Identification and documentation of critical, major, and minor defects.
- 📝 Creation of clear and reproducible bug reports.
- 🧩 Verification of consistency between points A and B, travel modes, and transport types.
- 💻 User interface validation: address fields, modes, and functional icons.
- ⚙️ Confirmation of accurate trip duration and price calculation logic.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Applied
####  Requirements Analysis and Planning
Worked with the QA team-provided test cases, identifying:
- Dependencies between fields and transport modes.
- Explicit and implicit business rules.
- Positive and negative scenarios affecting the user experience.
- Potential regression risks impacting critical functionalities.
<br/>
This analysis allowed me to structure a clear and efficient test execution plan, ensuring full regression coverage.

#### Regression Test Execution
During test execution:
- Followed all steps detailed in the test case template (ID, title, precondition, step description, expected result).
- Assigned status to each test case: Passed, Failed, or Skipped.
- Compared actual results against expected results, identifying discrepancies representing application defects.
- Applied logical reasoning to anticipate issues not explicitly covered in the test cases.
<br/>
These actions validated the stability of the application after recent changes and ensured proper functionality of critical flows.

##  Bug Documentation
For each failure detected:
- Created detailed bug reports including ID, title, steps, expected result, and actual result.
- Classified each defect by severity: Blocker, Critical, Major, Minor, or Trivial.
- Ensured reports were clear, reproducible, and actionable, enabling the development team to address issues efficiently.
<br/>
The documentation contributes to complete traceability between test cases and detected defects.

#### Tools Used
- `Google Sheets ` — tracking test cases, status, and bug reports.
- `Google Chrome ` — executing tests and validating the interface.
- `QA Methodologies ` — regression testing, scenario-based design, critical flow validation.
- `Agile Testing Techniques ` — iterative approach, incremental reporting, alignment with acceptance criteria.

## ⚙️ Functionalities Analyzed and Validated
 - Route creation flows: From / To, mode selection (Optimal, Flash, Personal).
 - Transport types: user car, walking, taxi, scooter, bike, or car sharing.
 - Duration and price calculation: validated time and cost algorithms based on distance and transport mode.
 - User interface: fields, buttons, icons, and error messages.
 - Test states: proper handling of Passed, Failed, and Skipped cases.

## 📦 Demonstrated Skills
- Execution of regression testing in real environments.
- Detection and documentation of bugs with clarity and traceability.
- Validation of critical flows and business rules.
- Analysis of results and comparison with acceptance criteria.
- Structured communication oriented to the development team.
- Critical thinking applied to user scenarios and potential failures.

## 🧩Key Points
- Turned predefined test cases into an organized and measurable execution process.
- Identified and documented all defects expected for the sprint.
- Ensured complete coverage of critical application flows.
- Created clear, reproducible, and prioritized bug reports.
- Integrated evaluator feedback quickly and effectively, showing learning and continuous improvement.
## Conclusion
This project allowed me to demonstrate my capacity as a Junior QA Engineer, executing regression tests in a structured and professional manner.
Through requirements analysis, test execution, defect identification, and documentation of findings, I ensured the stability and functionality of Urban Routes.
The outcome reflects discipline, critical thinking, attention to detail, and mastery of QA best practices, preparing me to integrate into a team and contribute quality from day one.
